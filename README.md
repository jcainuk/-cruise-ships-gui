Cruise ships project:

A JavaScript project from the Software Engineering Fasttrack course at Manchester Codes. 

The project utilises JavaScript code to simulate cruise ships sailing around the world and docking at various different ports.

In this project we practised creating a GUI in the browser.

General info:

The purpose of this project is to practise the following skills:

Object-oriented Programming (OOP)

Features:

There are 3 object classes interacting with each other in this project.

Ship objects have port and itinerary objects. 

Ships move from port to port and can also dock at ports.

Ports can see which ships are docked at them. 

Itineraries show the previous and next ports the ship was/will be at.
